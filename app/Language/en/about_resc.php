    'p1' => 'The idea for this website came to me as I was beginning my research for my PhD. I work on slave narratives published before the Civil War and I quickly realized that no two researchers agree on what a slave narrative is and that those who make a list do not really explain what criteria they used to make up this list and as a consequence, the lists are different from one researcher to the next. The aim of this website is thus to give a list, as thorough as possible, of the narratives alluded to by researchers but with comments on what makes them (or do not make them) slave narratives. For the moment we focus on the narratives written before the Civil War but including also the narratives written after the Civil War could be considered in the future.',

Sarah Wroblewski, Lazare Sauger Chevillot and Léo Le Gourriérec, Master 1 SIGMA students developed the maps then Florent Laidin, Master 2 SIGMA student created the site with the help of these maps (Louise Thomas also contributed to the site through its work on security issues). All this would not have been possible without the help of Mr. Laurent Jégou, co-manager of the Master SIGMA, his help and advice (which went beyond the sole supervision of the design offices) were invaluable. I also thank, always, Nathalie Dessens, my thesis director, for her encouragement, advice and support for what was a slightly crazy idea at the start.'
